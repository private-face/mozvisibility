h1. MozVisibility

MozVisibility - a small library for partial emulation of "Page Visibility API":http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-page-visibility-20110602/ in Firefox 5.0+.

At this moment only Chrome 13+ and IE9+ natively support Page Visibility API.


h2. How it works

Functioning principle of this library is based on the "following feature, introduced in Firefox 5.0":https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=633421: when the page is in inactive tab Firefox clamps setTimeout/setInterval that lesser than 1 second to 1 second.

Therefore, by setting timeout with 500ms delay and calculating the actual delay between setting and firing timeout, we can detect wether page visible or not.


h2. Usage

Add mozvisibility.js to your project. 

h3. document.mozVisibilityState & document.mozHidden

To detect wether page visible or not, you can use the following properties:
<pre>document.mozVisibilityState 	// can be ‘visible’ or ‘hidden’
document.mozHidden 				// can be true or false
</pre>

h3. “mozvisibilitychange” event

<pre>document.addEventListener("mozvisibilitychange", function () {
	console.log(‘Page became', document.mozHidden ? 'invisible' : 'visible');
}, false);
</pre>

h3. visibility.js

You can also use this library in conjunction with "visibility.js":https://github.com/evilmartians/visibility.js. In this case include mozvisibility.js BEFORE visiblity.js.

h2. Limitations & known issues

* The library detects page as invisible ONLY when it is in the background tab. Other types of invisiblity cannot be detected at this time.
* Time between setting page invisible and firing the “mozvisibilitychange” event may be up to 2 seconds (for obvious reasons).
* There is a small probability of false "mozvisibilitychange" event invocation.
